								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/representative_vs_unaugmented_training.png" alt="" /></span>When spectra aren't available for measuring redshifts, they can be estimated using photometry, called photometric redshifts, or photo-z's. There are two primary ways of estimating photo-z's: template-fitting and machine learning. Template fitting methods require a set of galaxy SED templates and the filter transmission curves for your data set as inputs. The photometry in each band can then be calculated from each SED in the template set at various redshifts. For each galaxy in your photometric sample, the photometry is compared to the photometry generated from the SED template set to find the best fitting template and redshift. In the case of machine learning, an input training sample with both photometry and spectroscopic redshifts is required. This training sample is then used to learn the relationship between the photometry and redshift using your favorite machine learning algorithm. The learned relationship is then applied to your photometric data to estimate redshifts.</p>
								<p>The reliance of machine learning methods on a spectroscopic tranining sample requires that training sample to be representative of the data you want to estimate redshifts for. However, existing spectroscopic catalogs are not representative of anticipated LSST data. Spectra are easier to obtain for brighter, redder galaxies, which also tend to be at lower redshift. Even DESI, which will obtain large quantities of high quality spectra, won't be as deep as LSST, meaning that LSST will be reliant on non-representative training samples for photo-z estimation. A non-representative training sample would lead to catastrophically poor photo-z estimates for a large portion of LSST galaxies, leading to reduced constraining power and bias in cosmological parameters obtained from LSST data. The image on the right shows what photo-z estimation could look like if this problem is not addressed. Each panel shows the true redshift on the x-axis vs the photo-z estimate on the y-axis. The top panel shows the photo-z estimates for a sample of simulated LSST-like galaxies when a fully representative training sample was used. The bottom panel shows the photo-z estimates for the sample sample of simulated galaies, but when a realistically non-representative training sample is used. In the non-representative case, the outlier fraction reaches nearly 50%. It is thus very important to find a way to improve the photo-z estimates without relying on a large volume of new spectra for training.</p>
